Developer's Guide
=================

Setup
-----

First, you should clone the GitHub repository and checkout the develop branch.

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:adopy/adopy.git
    cd adopy
    git checkout develop

To manage a virtual environment for development, we uses `poetry`_. Pipfile on
the repository describes which packages to install for a virtual environment.
You can create a virtual environment by running the command below:

.. _poetry:
   https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry

.. code:: bash

    # Install the virtual environment defined in the pyproject.toml
    poetry install

Now you can activate the installed virtual environment. Code blocks on later
sections assume this environment activated.

.. code:: bash

    # Activate the virtual environment
    poetry shell

Writing documentation
---------------------

The documentation is generated based on `Sphinx`_. Sphinx provides its rich
features using `reStructuredText`_ files for its markup language. Thus, to get
benefits from Sphinx, this documentation website is created from
reStructuredText sources on ``/docs/source`` directory.

.. _Sphinx:
   http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
.. _reStructuredText:
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html

Basically, the official website (https://adopy.org) is automatically generated
from documentations in the Python codes on ``/adopy`` and reStructuredText
files (``*.rst``) on ``/docs/source``, in ``master`` branch of the
repository. In other words, the documentations shown in the website are for the
stable version of ADOpy in ``master`` branch.

Using ``sphinx-autobuild``, you can build the documentation and test it by
yourself. It can run a web server for documentation on http://localhost:8000,
as described below.

.. _sphinx-autobuild:
   https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/

.. code:: bash

    # Go to /docs directory
    cd docs

    # On Windows
    livehtml.bat

    # On macOS or Linux
    make livehtml

Branch management
-----------------

The basic process of ADOpy development follows the `Gitflow workflow by Vincent
Driessen`_, which holds two main branches: ``master`` and ``develop``.
Only an exception is that we use ``feature/*``, ``hotfix/*``, or ``release/*``
instead of ``feature-*``, ``hotfix-*`` or ``release-*``.
There are a bunch of great resources about Gitflow and we require you to read
at least one of them before proceeding.

If you want to contribute to ADOpy, you can start with forking the ADOpy
repository in the GitHub. Before you start writing a code, please make a new
issue for what you want to do. Then, following the Gitflow, you should make a
proper branch to work with. We only allow feature branches for who is not
authorized. If your job is done, you can make a pull request on the ADOpy
repository and let us review it before merging it.
